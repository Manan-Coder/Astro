    <h1>Celestial Objects</h1>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Solar System</h3>
        <p class="object-title">a) Sun</p>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies.</p>
        <p class="object-title">b) Planets</p>
        <p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is generally required to be in orbit around a star. Planets in our Solar System are - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
        <p class="object-title">c) Asteroids</p>
        <p>An asteroid is a minor planet—an object that is neither a true planet nor an identified comet— that orbits within the inner Solar System. They are rocky, metallic, or icy bodies with no atmosphere.</p>
        <p class="object-title">d) Meteors</p>
        <p>A meteor, known colloquially as a shooting star or falling star, is the visible passage of a glowing meteoroid, micrometeoroid, comet or asteroid through Earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p class="object-title">e) Meteoroids</p>
        <p>A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body in outer space. Meteoroids are distinguished as objects significantly smaller than asteroids, ranging in size from grains to objects up to a meter wide.</p>
        <p class="object-title">f) Asteroid Belt</p>
        <p>The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun and roughly spanning the space between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Black Holes</h3>
        <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime wherein gravity is so strong that no matter or electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) can escape it. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Pulsars</h3>
        <p>A pulsar (from pulsating radio source) is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Stars</h3>
        <p>A star is a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Neutron Stars</h3>
        <p>A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star. It results from the supernova explosion of a massive star—combined with gravitational collapse—that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Comets</h3>
        <p>A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that warms and begins to release gases when passing close to the Sun, a process called outgassing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Galaxies</h3>
        <p>A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. The Milky Way galaxy contains the Solar System. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with fewer than a thousand stars to supergiants with one hundred trillion stars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Star Clusters</h3>
        <p>Star clusters are large groups of stars held together by self-gravitation. Two main types are globular clusters, which are tight groups of old stars, and open clusters, which are more loosely clustered and often very young.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Nebulae</h3>
        <p>Nebulae are interstellar clouds of gas and dust. Many nebulae are formed from the remnants of dying stars and are regions where new stars are born.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="object">
        <h3>Quasars</h3>
        <p>A quasar is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN). The emission from an AGN is powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc.</p>
